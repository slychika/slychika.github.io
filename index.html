						<p> Hi there! It is very nice to meet you!</p>

 						<p>I graduated for the University of Colorado at Boulder in May of 2015. My degree is a Bachelor's of  Science in Computer Science. While in school, I was very busy. I lead the <a target="_blank" href="wic.cs.colorado.edu">Women in Computing Group </a> for 2 years, and worked hard to ensure equality for every technical woman on campus. I also discovered a love for Video Games, when a friend introduced me to the Kingdom Hearts series and the wonder of Steam.</p>

 						<p>Now, I continue to work hard as an advocate for diversity in Computer Science. I volunteer with  the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coderdojoboulder.com/">Boulder CoderDojo</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://innovation.svvsd.org/">Innovation Center</a> to introduce children of all ages to computers  and technology. I have continued my partnership with the Women in Computing Group at CU and have positioned myself as an industry consultant and mentor to the team. I am also working as a Jr. Application Developer at <a target="_blank" href="www.zayo.com">Zayo Group</a>. I take my experience in leadership to bring new insights to the company, and am currently working on a system to assist in developer management within our Salesforce environment.</p>

						<p>When I'm not being an advocate or working, I spend my time at the gym, engineering games, reading, writing music, making online videos and blogs, working on story ideas with friends and playing games until my wrists hurt.</p>

I'm working on a dynamic Visual Novel using the ren'py engine. I am trying my hands at total game design, attempting my own original compositions of the story, music and art. I am using this as a way to understand a full game cycle, so that when presented work with a team on other projects, I may better understand their needs.</p>
