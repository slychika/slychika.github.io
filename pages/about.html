				<div>
					<p> Hi there! It is very nice to meet you! </p>

					<p>I graduated for the University of Colorado at Boulder in May of 2015, Where I receieved a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. While in school, I lead the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CUWomenInComputing/">Women in Computing Group </a> for 2 years, and worked hard to ensure equality for every technical woman on campus.</p>

					<p>In my career at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zayo.com">Zayo Group</a> I work as a Development Operations Specialist, where I take my experience in leadership to bring new insights to the company. My current project is to convert our classic Salesforce environment to the Lightning Experience. The project involves project management, refactoring of Apex and VisualForce components, creation of all new Lightning componets, education of our developers on development best practices and cleaning up technical debt in our environment. My past projects included development of a development asset tracking system, procurement of development tools that help increase developer productivity, and management of teams working to expedite the development process.</p>

					<p>I spend much of my time outside of work volunteering my knowledge to help others. I help select scholars for Greenhouse Scholars and NCWIT High School and College Scholarships and mentor many community members through Zayo's Coffee Club and Zayo's Galvanize Mentorship programs.</p>

					<p>I'm not all work and no play though, I greatly enjoy spending my free time at the gym, reading, writing and playing games video games until my wrists hurt. </p>
