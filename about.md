Heather Storm is a graduate of the University of Colorado at Boulder where she receieved a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. She has a lifetime of experience in technology, having built her first computer at just 10 years old. She currently works at Epic Games as a Senior Manager of Creator Evangelism, a job that allows her to be a leader, an advocate, and a game developer. 

She spends much of her time outside of work volunteering, with [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/heatherstorm). Heather serves as Guild Liason for the Extra Life - Colorado Guild. She also serves on the global Extra Life Community Council. She believes that the future health of the world starts with making sure kids are well cared for.

When not working or volunteering, she's likely reading, writing, crocheting, knitting, cross-stitching, playing video games, or cuddling with her cats and dogs.
